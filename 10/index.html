            <h2>
                Why do we need a wireframe tool?
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Wireframe tools exist in order to aid and assist web designers and software engineers when laying out a website. A wireframe tool will most likely be used to make a relatively quick approximation of what a site will look like. Wireframer3000 will help bring substance to developers ideas, so that others can review and revise them.
            </p>
            <p>The reason for using wireframe tools is to avoid creating an image that looks exactly like a finished web page. Instead, it tries to create a rough outline of what the designer envisions. This will avoid dwelling on the exact look and feel of the website, and allow the ideas and layout to be the focus. Creating iterations of wireframes is a great way to quickly create prototypes of web pages instead of creating full fledged versions in HTML. Another benefit of creating wireframes is that it helps developers understand the functionality of a website, and understand how different elements work together and create a valuable experience for the end user.
            </p>
            <h2>Who is it built for?</h2>
            <p>Wireframer3000 is built for anyone to easily create a web page design without worrying about the details. Solely using sketches of visual elements, such as buttons, menus, and pictures, allows for anyone to create a design without any coding. This means web designers, as well as anyone with an idea for a website, will have access to the tools necessary to quickly represent that idea.
            </p>
            <p>In many companies there will be people whose only job is to create these visual representations of websites. At the same time, regular web designers or software engineers will find our wireframe tool useful as well if they have the need to lay their ideas out of a website. Additionally, even a customer with no computer background could use our tool to more efficiently present their ideas to the person that is making their website. All of these use cases suggest that our tool will be advanced enough for the power user, but simple and streamlined enough for the everyday user.
            </p>
            <h2>How will people use it?</h2>
            <p>A user will be able to access our wireframe tool from their desktop, laptop, or mobile device. They will be presented with a page that has access to all the items and features that will be needed to create a complete wireframe. The three main areas of our page are the tool menu, side bar, and the mockup area. A user will initially be presented with a blank canvas in the mockup area, and will proceed to select a category of items where their desired item is. Then, they can scroll through the side bar to find their desired item, and drag and drop it into the mockup area. Once in the mockup area, the user can use tools to alter the item, such as grouping it with other items, locking it in place, etc. Once the user has their desired layout, they can either share it directly from the mockup area, or export a picture to their hard disk that they can use later. This tool can be used as a fast way for companies or individuals to make a prototype of a web page.</p>
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>Ultimately, most of our limitations come from the reduced timeframe of this course. One feature that we will most likely not be able to implement is the Relative Positioning feature, where items being placed in the mockup area can be snapped to a position relative to other items in the mockup area. This feature would require us to keep track of all the positions of the items in the mockup area and be able to calculate a good position based on these positions. The complexity of this feature would make it hard to implement in the allotted time. Also, the number of items that a user can choose from must be limited since we will be programming how each specific item acts. We believe that we have given the user a well rounded selection with our 5 categories of items to add. Another feature that we will most likely not be able to implement is the Linking feature, where objects can create links to other wireframe pages. This would require us to allow the user to save their pages somehow, which is not a good idea to do on the client side.</p>
